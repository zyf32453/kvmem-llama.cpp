// Block-sparse KV attention — block repository + working-set selection.
//
// A single long context (agent multi-turn, cumulative up to ~1M tokens) is
// split into fixed-size blocks (default 128 tokens, independent of the 16-token
// physical KV page). Each selection round an external algorithm (v1: built-in
// cumulative-attention top-k) picks a set of block IDs within the model's
// context budget (e.g. 128k). Only selected blocks are used for attention;
// they are remapped into a contiguous in-window position range via re-RoPE
// (see rope_block_remap_kernel) so RoPE stays in-distribution.
//
// This module is PURE HOST LOGIC: block metadata, selection, the diff that
// drives stage-in / stage-out, and the position remap plan. It owns no GPU
// memory and calls no kernels — the executor consumes its output (a per-block
// remap plan + the set of blocks to stage) to assemble the live page-index
// list. Keeping it host-only makes the selection/diff math unit-testable
// without a GPU (see tests/kv_block_store_test.cpp).
//
// Scope note: blocks/selection/tiering/remap apply ONLY to standard attention
// layers (1/4 of layers in Qwen3.6). DeltaNet recurrent layers store O(1)
// state and are untouched. Selection is GLOBAL (all attention layers share the
// same selected block IDs); the per-layer dimension is reserved for later.
